[space-location-description]
secretas=Guardian of the galaxy. Large objects that would smash into planets are typically captured by Secretas, and the planet is so massive that contorts the orbits of the outer most celestial bodies. This gaseous might contains a dense ring of asteroids that makes reaching a stable orbit around it a challenge. Many have traveled to this world to harvest the rare-metal asteroids around Secretas, only to be decimated. The ruins of the ships either falling to its largest moon Frozeta, or lost forever in the belly of Secretas.
frozeta=Covered in dense a sheet of ice, this world is scarred by asteroids and filled with a graveyard of graveyard of ships decimated by Secretasâ€™s dense asteroid field. Spaceship scrap is abundant, and advanced technology can be salvaged from wrecks. Receives less sunlight than Aquillo, and similarly requires heating infrastructure for any machines to function.
