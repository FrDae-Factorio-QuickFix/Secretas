  Bugfixes:
    - Not enough recycler slots to receive all potential scrap outputs. Didn't realize all those slots were necessary at first. Thanks to Semenanr for bringing this to my attention. Steam recycler and vanilla recycler now have 40 output slots, so you can now get all outputs from spaceship scrap!
